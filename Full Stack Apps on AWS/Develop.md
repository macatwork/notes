# Develop
### Getting Setup
#### Installing Node and NPM
Install via https://nodejs.com/en/download

#### Installing Ionic CLI
The Ionic CLI is required to serve and build the frontend. Install via following the CLI docs.

#### Installing Python3
Powerful programming language, this will be used for the final project and it is required for some tools such as the AWS CLI.

### AWS CLI
Install the CLI, instructions can be found in the docs.

### Installing Useful Tools
#### Postbird
A GUI for Postgres

#### Postman 
Tool to issue and save requests to an API, can create GET, PUT, POST etc.

## How to Design an API
### What is a server
A 'computer' that is more reliable and has more storage in the cloud, it can be used to store files, host game servers and more.

### What is an API
An API allows the client and the server to interact, it can query a database stored on a server using information sent from the client.

### Consumable APIs
Consumable APIs: APIs that are accessible to those outside of the organization, for example, a consumable API allows programmers to search Tweet or Yelp reviews.

## Standing up a Cloud Capable Server
Node is a powerful framework to build network applications using JavaScript. Outside of browsers it has an asynchronous concurrent model which removes the developer from many concerns. Node is used as a server framework alongside Express to handle web http requests in this case.

### Introduction to Typescript
Typescript is a flavor of JS that forces hard typing on variables and methods. This prevents implementation errors like passing a string instead of a number it compiles to pure JavaScript

## Verification Testing
### Unit Tests
Ensure atomic functions and methods perform their tasks correctly. Using Mocha and Chai as the unit testing framework.

### Integration Tests
ensure every endpoint in the software package performs their tasks correctly, fails appropriately, and communicates with the other systems in a predictable manner. Using Postman as an integration testing framework.

### Defining Unit Tests with Mocha and Chia
Use the command `npm test` to run all files that match the pattern `*.tests.ts` and is defined in `package.json`

## Using Git Effectively for the Cloud
PR = Pull Request

## Using Packages
*Packages* aerr libraries of code that are written by other developers and made available through open-source licenses for the development community to use. NodeJS is a package
